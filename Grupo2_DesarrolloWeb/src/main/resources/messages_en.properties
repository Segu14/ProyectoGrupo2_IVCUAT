info.title=INFORMATION
info.about_us=Who We Are?
info.about_us_text=HERMES is a digital store dedicated to selling products that are free from any animal testing. Unfortunately, this motivation was driven by the current concern over aggression and abuse towards animals at the hands of companies conducting experiments for the production of products, such as cosmetics and hygiene items, which has reached significant levels.
info.about_us_text_2=As society becomes more aware of the need for respectful treatment of living beings, pressure on companies to adopt more ethical and sustainable practices intensifies, thus fostering a gradual shift in the industry towards more compassionate and responsible approaches.
info.about_us_text_3=Beautiful and valuable creatures inhabit this planet. Unfortunately, many of them have been used as test subjects, or as commonly termed, "lab rats." Our goal is to contribute by educating users about the seriousness of the situation and giving them the option to contribute their own bit.
